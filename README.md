# Statistical-Modelling-And-Hypothesis-Testing

## Statistical-Modelling
Statistical modelling is a mathematical framework used to describe the relationships between variables in the form of equations, 
usually involving stochastic elements (randomness). It is primarily focused on inference, 
which means understanding the relationships between variables and quantifying how certain factors influence outcomes.
